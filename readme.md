# Boost
[Vcpkg][vcpkg] [boost][boost] ports [overlay][overlay] that respects custom
[toolchains][toolchains] and installs CMake configuration files.

## Advantages
Advantages over the default vcpkg boost port are:

- Builds much faster.
- Installs working CMake configuration files.
- Uses the system layout (no more cryptic library names).
- Downloads all of boost at once instead of downloading single components.
- Uses compiler and compiler options set by the vcpkg toolchain.
- Generates `b2` configs that support MSVC, GCC and Clang.
- Respects the global `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` setting.

This port also includes libraries that are not yet part of the boost project.

## Disadvantages
Disadvantages over the default vcpkg boost port are (patches welcome):

- Disables the `mpi` and `graph_parallel` components to reduce build times.
- Disables the `python` component beacuse it is unclear which version to support.
- Does not build `libiconv` support because of the license.
- Does not build `icu` support because it requires MSYS2.
- Only supports 64-bit triplets for Windows and Linux.
- Components cannot be built separately.

## How it Works
- [create.cmake](create.cmake) generates empty ports for all boost components.
- [boost/CMakeLists.txt](boost/CMakeLists.txt) configures boost and builds all supported components.
- [boost/portfile.cmake](boost/portfile.cmake) installs boost and patches generated CMake configuration files.

## Requirements
Install [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) following the official documentation.

## Usage
Clone this repository and generate ports.

```cmd
cd C:/Workspace || cd /opt
git clone git@github.com:qis/boost boost
cmake -P boost/create.cmake
```

Install boost using the ports overlay.

```cmd
cd C:/Workspace || cd /opt
vcpkg install --overlay-ports=boost/ports boost
```
